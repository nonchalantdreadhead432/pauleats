# FireOrder — Supabase + free hosting setup

Follow these in order. Total cost: **$0** on Supabase's free tier and any of the free static hosts below, as long as your order volume stays modest (free tier covers 500MB database + 1GB file storage + 50k monthly active users — plenty for a small business).

## 1. Create your Supabase project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → sign up → **New project**.
2. Pick a name, set a database password (save it somewhere — you won't need it day-to-day, but you'll want it if you ever need direct DB access), pick the region closest to your customers.
3. Wait ~2 minutes for it to provision.

## 2. Run the database schema
1. In your project, open **SQL Editor** (left sidebar) → **New query**.
2. Paste in everything from `schema.sql` (included in this project) and click **Run**.
3. This creates the `orders` table and locks it down with Row Level Security: customers can only *submit* orders, only signed-in admins can *view/edit/delete* them.

## 3. Create the screenshots storage bucket
1. Go to **Storage** (left sidebar) → **New bucket**.
2. Name it exactly `screenshots`, toggle **Public bucket** ON, click **Create bucket**.
3. Back in **SQL Editor**, the two storage policies at the bottom of `schema.sql` should already be applied if you ran the whole file — if you ran it before creating the bucket, re-run just those two `create policy` statements now.

## 4. Create your admin login
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users** → **Add user** → **Create new user**.
2. Enter the email and password you want to log into the dashboard with. Check "Auto Confirm User" so you don't need to click an email link.
3. That's it — this is the account you'll use on the `login.html` page.

## 5. Connect the site to your project
1. In Supabase, go to **Project Settings → API**.
2. Copy the **Project URL** and the **anon public** key.
3. Open `config.js` in this project and paste them in:
   ```js
   const SUPABASE_URL = "https://your-project-ref.supabase.co";
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your-anon-public-key";
   ```
4. Open `orders.json` and update `paymentHandles` with your real Cash App/Zelle/PayPal/Apple Pay info.

## 6. Test it locally
Because the pages now fetch real files (`config.js`, `orders.json`) and call Supabase, opening `index.html` by double-clicking it may hit browser file:// restrictions. Easiest fix — run a tiny local server from inside the project folder:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Place a test order, then log into `http://localhost:8000/login.html` with the admin account from step 4 and confirm it shows up.

## 7. Deploy for free
Pick one:

**Netlify (easiest)**
1. Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2. Drag the whole project folder onto the page. Done — you get a live URL immediately.
3. Optional: claim a free `yourname.netlify.app` subdomain, or connect your own domain later (also free, you just pay for the domain itself if you don't already own one).

**Cloudflare Pages**
1. Go to [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com) → connect a GitHub repo with these files (or drag-and-drop, similar to Netlify).
2. Deploy — also free, with generous bandwidth.

**GitHub Pages**
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Repo → **Settings → Pages** → set source to your main branch.
3. Free, slightly more setup than the other two.

## 9. New features: chat, menu, today's restaurants
The schema.sql file now also creates `featured_restaurants`, `menu_items`, and `chat_messages` tables. If you already ran schema.sql once before, just re-run the whole file again — every statement uses `if not exists` / `on conflict` / safe patterns so it won't break your existing orders data, it'll just add the new tables and policies.

**Today's Restaurants tab (admin):** just 3 name fields — whatever you type shows up as chips on the homepage instantly.

**Menu tab (admin):** add/hide/delete shared menu items (name, category, price, description). This is one flat list, not tied to any specific restaurant — customers browse it on `menu.html`.

**Chat:** every visitor gets a floating chat bubble (bottom-right) backed by `faq.json` — it answers common questions instantly, and every message (customer + bot) is also saved so you can see and reply to any conversation live from the admin Chat tab. Edit `faq.json` to change what the bot knows.

**Note on chat privacy:** conversations are identified by a random ID stored in the customer's browser, not a real login — practically private, but not true per-user security. Don't rely on it for anything sensitive.

## 11. Homepage: Recent Orders (now pulled from Telegram)

The "Recent orders 🔥" section on the homepage pulls its photos and captions directly from your **public Telegram channel**, via a Supabase Edge Function — not from customer-submitted screenshots anymore. This needs the same Edge Function setup either way, so follow **Option A** below regardless.

(The `public_recent_orders()` database function from `schema.sql` is still there and harmless to leave — it's just not used by the homepage anymore. If you ever want to switch back to showing real customer order screenshots instead of Telegram posts, it's ready to go — just ask.)

This is a step up in complexity from the rest of the site — it needs a real server-side piece (a Supabase **Edge Function**), because browsers can't fetch Telegram's pages directly (CORS blocks it).

**You'll need the Supabase CLI installed** (this part can't be done through drag-and-drop, unlike the rest of the site):
```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref   # find this in your Supabase project URL
```

**Option A: Telegram (what powers Recent Orders)**

Works with any *public* Telegram channel — no bot, no login, no API key.

1. Deploy the function:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy telegram-feed --no-verify-jwt
   ```
2. Set your channel's username as a secret (the part after `t.me/` in your channel's link):
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set TELEGRAM_CHANNEL=your_channel_username
   ```
3. Redeploy your site files to Netlify — no `config.js` change needed for this one anymore, the homepage calls `telegram-feed` directly.

**Heads up:** this works by reading Telegram's public web preview page, since Telegram's official Bot API doesn't let a bot fetch a channel's post history. It's a common technique but unofficial — if Telegram changes that page's layout, photos might stop showing up until the function's parsing logic is updated. Nothing breaks elsewhere on your site if that happens — the section just shows a friendly "couldn't load" message.

Until you deploy this function, the Recent Orders section will show a message pointing back to this setup step — everything else on the site works fine either way.

---

**Option B: Instagram (available if you want a *separate* gallery later)**

The `instagram-feed` function from before is still in the project and untouched, in case you want to add a second, Instagram-specific gallery section somewhere on the site down the line. It's not wired into the homepage right now. Just ask if you want it added back in.

## 13. Order tracking
Customers can look up their own order at `track.html` using their order number + the phone number they gave when ordering (the phone acts as a lightweight check so people can't just guess order numbers to see others' status). This just needs the updated `schema.sql` re-run — it adds a `tracking_url` column and a `public_track_order()` function that only exposes status/tracking link/date, never name or address.

**To add a tracking link to an order:** open it in the admin **Orders** tab, paste the link into the new "Tracking link" field, and hit save. It shows up for the customer immediately — no separate step needed to "publish" it.

## 15. Store open/closed toggle
New admin tab: **Store Status**. Flip the checkbox off and add a reason ("Stepped out for lunch, back at 2pm!") and hit save — the homepage instantly shows that message instead of letting people submit new orders. Flip it back on when you're back. Needs the updated `schema.sql` re-run (adds a `store_status` table).

## 16. Multiple payment handles + payment screenshots
**Multiple accounts per method:** open `orders.json` — any payment method can now be either a single string or a list:
```json
"cashapp": ["$YourCashApp1", "$YourCashApp2"],
"applepay": "(551) 555-0134",
"paypal": "paypal.me/yourhandle",
"zelle": "you@yourzelle.com"
```
**Fill in your real handles here** — the placeholders won't mean anything to customers. If a method is a list, one is picked at random per order, and *which one* gets saved with that order so you can match it up later (visible in the admin Orders tab when you open an order).

**Payment note:** the confirmation screen now tells customers to put their order number in the payment note/memo — this is the only way to match a payment to an order manually, since Cash App/Apple Pay/Zelle/PayPal don't offer a way for a website to detect an incoming payment automatically without a business banking API integration (a much bigger project). This screenshot approach is the practical middle ground.

**Payment screenshot:** after placing an order, customers can optionally upload a screenshot of the payment itself. It attaches to that exact order (verified by order number + phone, so no one else can attach to someone else's order) and shows up right in the order detail in your Orders tab, next to their order screenshot — so you can visually confirm payment before marking an order Confirmed. Needs the updated `schema.sql` re-run (adds `payment_handle` and `payment_screenshot_url` columns, plus a safe attach function).

## 17. Deals (price checker)
New admin tab: **Deals**. Add a title, price, and optional description (e.g. "Zaxby's Large Meal + Dessert — $10, includes a drink"). Customers browse these at `deals.html` (linked from the homepage) so they know what to screenshot and expect to pay before ordering. This is a straightforward priced list, not a build-your-own combo calculator — if you want customers to pick items and see a live total instead, that's a bigger feature, just ask. Needs the updated `schema.sql` re-run (adds a `deals` table).

## 18. Ongoing costs to watch (updated)
Everything above is free at small scale. You'd only start paying if:
- Your Supabase project exceeds the free tier's database/storage/bandwidth limits (Supabase will email you before this happens).
- You want a custom domain (e.g. `fireorder.com`) — the domain itself typically costs $10–15/year; the hosting stays free.

## Notes on this being a "real" backend
- Orders now live in Supabase's Postgres database, not the browser — so a customer ordering from their phone shows up instantly on your laptop's dashboard (thanks to the realtime subscription in `admin.js`).
- Admin login is real Supabase Auth now (email + password checked server-side), not the client-side password hash from before — this is actually secure.
- Row Level Security policies are what keep customers from reading or editing each other's orders, and keep the orders table private from the public internet — don't remove them.
